The project will utilize data from two sources. The first will be the location data that will be obtained from the foursquare API. the second data set will be the college dataset that has been sourced from Opendatasoft. The colleges and university dataset is composed of all Post Secondary Education facilities as defined by the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS), National Center for Education Statistics, US Department of Education. Included are Doctoral/Research Universities, Masters Colleges and Universities, Baccalaureate Colleges, Associates Colleges, Theological seminaries, Medical Schools and other health care professions, schools of engineering and technology, business and management, art, music, design, Law schools, Teachers colleges, Tribal colleges, and other specialized institutions. Overall, this data layer covers all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico and other assorted U.S. territories. This feature class contains all MEDS/MEDS+ as approved by NGA. For each field, the 'Not available' and 'NULL' designations are used to indicate that the data for the particular record and field is currently unavailable and will be populated when and if that data becomes available. The data set can be found at:https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-colleges-and-universities%40public-us/information/?sort=population. The location of each college can be converted to coordinates and then fed into the foursquare API to get the relevant results which will then be used to cluster the colleges.
