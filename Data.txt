The project will utilize data from two sources. The first will be the location data that will be obtained from the foursquare API. the second data set will be 
the college dataset which has been sourced from Kaggle. The data set can be found at:https://www.kaggle.com/flyingwombat/us-news-and-world-reports-college-data/data.
This is dataset contains statistics for a large number of US Colleges from the 1995 issue of US News and World Report. The location of each college can be converted
to coordinates and then fed into the foursquare API to get the relevant results which will then be used to cluster the colleges.
