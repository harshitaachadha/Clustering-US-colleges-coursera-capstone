When applying to any college or university, whether it is at the undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral level, one of the concerns of the applicant is the kind 
of location the institution is situated in. This consideration includes the nature of the nearest neighborhoods, the amenities, and the services available. 
The objective of this project will be to use a college dataset as sourced from Kaggle and along with it leverage the foursquare API to segment the colleges as 
located in the US into clusters based on their neighborhood information. The dataset that will result from this exercise will serve as an information source to 
potential applicants and may help them in their quest to find a university or college that best fits their needs.
